	<p id="p_body"> About Us</p>
	<p id="p_about"> We are a non profit organization dedicated to the ongoing efforts in cancer research and ongoing studies.  Our collective is founded on the principles that cancer, in any form, can be treated and eliminated with the proper funding, tools and staffers in our affiliated research facilities.  Through donations, charitable events and fundraisers, we are already on the way to make this world a healthier place with a better understanding of what causes and what can prevent these still life-threatening diseases.  It is our goal, our hope, to one day be able to take the steps towards one day treatment of different strains of the disease, that the days of radiation and cancer therapies will be a thing of the past.  This website was created to give information about our causes and our research, so that no family is left in the dark about what is happening to their loved ones, family members or friends, or even those who feel as if they may be going through it alone and that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, that in the near future we will live in a world where all forms of cancer are a thing of the past.  We fight for the future.  </p>
